                The <ins>first principle</ins> of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to have
                <strong>faith in Him</strong>. The topic of faith is one of the most
                discussed in many of our church meetings. Modern prophets have taught
                that having faith is not simply believing in God.
                <b>Elder Dallin H. Oaks</b> said,
                <cite
                >“Faith means trust—trust in God’s will, trust in His way of doing
                things, and trust in His timetable.”<sup

            <p>
                In this essay I will discuss the pattern of
                <strong>trusting in God </strong>. Please note that this pattern is
                <b>not</b> the only way of showing our trust in Him. This is based on
                the story of Jesus’s first miracle in <mark>John 2:2-10</mark>. The
                items of the pattern are
                <i
                >communicating with God, listening to His answers, and acting upon the
                answers that we receive</i
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, <em>communicating with God</em> shows that we trust Him. We can
                communicate with God in many ways. <b>Elder Robert D. Hales</b> taught,
                <cite
                >“when we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak
                to us, we search the scriptures…”
                <sup
                    ><a
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2006/11/holy-scriptures-the-power-of-god-unto-our-salvation?lang=eng"
                    >2</a
                    ></sup
                ></cite
                >. We show our trust in Him when we pray because we trust that He is
                there listening to the humble petitions of our hearts. And as we read
                the scriptures, we show Him that we are willing to receive instructions
                from Him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, <em>listening to His answers</em> is another act of trust. We
                often see in the scriptures the word <b><i>‘Hearken’</i></b
                >. <b>President Nelson</b> taught that the meaning of the word hearken
                is to <ins>listen with the intent to obey</ins
                ><sup
                ><a
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ftsoy/2021/01/hear-hearken-and-heed?lang=eng"
                    >3</a
                ></sup
                >. Hearkening to His words shows that we trust in His wisdom.
            </p>

            <p>
                The prophet <b>Joseph Smith</b> is an example of trusting God when he
                acted upon the scriptures that he had read in <mark>James 1:5</mark>. A
                direct instruction from the Father as His answer to the prayer of the
                boy Joseph Smith says, <b><i>“…Hear Him.”</i></b
                ><sup
                ><a
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17"
                    >4</a
                ></sup
                >. Joseph Smith’s <ins>listening with the intent to obey</ins> to the
                words of God resulted in the restoration of the fulness of his Gospel.
                Our intent to obey as we listen can also result into a miracle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, we show our trust in Him when we
                <em>act upon the answers that we receive</em>. In the wedding feast,
                Mary instructed the servants to do whatever Jesus says. Then Jesus told
                the servants to fill the waterpots with water, and they did. And what
                happened next is His first miracle during His mortal ministry; turning
                water into wine. We might sometimes think that His answers are
                impossible. Nephi mentioned in <mark>1 Nephi 17:41</mark> that many have
                perished because they did not look upon the brazen serpent that the Lord
                instructed Moses to make. As we act to what He and His prophet say,
                miracles happen and our testimony grows.
