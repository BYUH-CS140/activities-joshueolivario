                <p class="gallery-intro">
                    I live in a small village called Pag-asa, which means "hope" in English. It is located within
                    the borders of Barangay Wawa—with Wawa meaning "the mouth of the river." Our village is blessed
                    with a river that flows into Manila Bay, making fishing the most common source of livelihood in
                    the area. I grew up in a family of fishermen, and this peaceful riverside community is where I
                    spent my childhood, playing by the water and exploring nature. The images below capture the
                    beauty of the place where I was raised—each photo tells a story of the land that shaped my early
                    years. Below is a description of each image in the order they appear on this page.
